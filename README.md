# Matrix-Multiplication-using-C-
Matrix Multiplication This is a C++ program that performs matrix multiplication. Given two matrices, it calculates their product matrix.

Prerequisites
* C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
* Basic understanding of matrices and matrix multiplication

How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the source code files are located.
4. Compile the code using the C++ compiler.
For example:
g++ matrix_multiplication.cpp -o matrix_multiplication

5. Run the compiled program: ./matrix_multiplication
6. Follow the prompts to enter the dimensions and elements of the matrices.
7. The program will output the resulting matrix after performing matrix multiplication.

Usage: 
The program prompts the user to enter the dimensions (rows and columns) of two matrices. 
The user then enters the elements of the two matrices, one by one. 
The program performs matrix multiplication and displays the resulting matrix.
